      <div class="text">The framework I chose for this lab is React. I encountered many issues while doing this part of the lab because I had no prior knowledge or any clue on how to start. I read many different articles and each one had a different complicated way of how to start! But, essentially I understood that I need to build an environment and did so by downloading Node.js on my terminal. I thought the hard part was behind me, but then I used "Code ." to code this program with VSCode. It had so many different files and folders and I was very overwhelmed and confused about how to start and where. Then, I spent 3 hours trying to set a background colour for this web just to realize there is a body class in the file "index.css". But after understanding what each file is doing and getting rid of unnecessary files, I managed to style the web with no problems and found it simple.               </div>
